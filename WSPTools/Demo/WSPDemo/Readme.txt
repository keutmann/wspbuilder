WSPDemo

This demo shows how to use the WSPBuilder application to create a solution that 
contains the webpart, feature and the layout page.

Build:

* Compile in release mode.
* Run the wspbuilder

Run setup.exe (Setup.exe is the installer from Ontolica).


The webpart will display a "Hello world".
The feature will add a link on the Site Settings page.
Remember to activate the feature under Site Collection Features.
